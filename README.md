# MuffinService

Muffin service is a news reader, that aims to save time spent reading news from different sources.
<br/>
It extracts RSS links from domains to create a reading list.
The reading lists/articles are then summarised into bite-sized muffins.



(CHALLENGES/FUTURE PLANS)
Many news sites have stopped support for RSS.
Muffin would be able to resort to crawling to creating reading lists.

MODULES
MuffinService - backend responsible for processing RSS links, crawling websites, and creating news summary.
MuffinAPi - API Endpoints for Muffin Service.

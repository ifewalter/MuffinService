# MuffinService

Muffin service is a news reader, that aims to save time spent reading news from different sources.
<br/>
It extracts RSS links from domains to create a reading list.
The reading lists/articles are then summarised into bite-sized muffins.



CHALLENGES/FUTURE PLANS
<br/>
Many news sites have stopped support for RSS.
Muffin would be able to resort to crawling to creating reading lists.

<br/>
<br/>

MODULES
<br/>
MuffinService - backend responsible for processing RSS links, crawling websites, and creating news summary.
MuffinAPi - API Endpoints for Muffin Service.

HONOURABLE MENTIONS <br/>
The project uses other projects
Newspaper - for parsing articles from web pages: https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper
Sumy - for summarization: https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy
